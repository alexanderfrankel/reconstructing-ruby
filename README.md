== Reconstructing Ruby

Reconstructing Ruby is an attempt to re-create the basic functionality of the Ruby Programming Language. All work completed has been taken from the blog post entitled "Reconstructing Ruby" from halogenandtoast.com and is in no way an attempt to take credit.

Enjoy and MINSWAN!
